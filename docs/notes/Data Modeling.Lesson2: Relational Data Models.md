Learn the fundamentals of how to do relational data modeling by focusing on:

- Normalization
- Denormalization
- Fact/dimension tables
- Different schema models

Database: A set of related data and the way it is organized

Database Management System: Computer software that allows users to interact with the database and provides access to all of the data.

The term database is often used to refer to both the database and the DBMS used.

Rule 1: The information rule: what we are trying to achive with relational modeling.

All information in a relational database is represented explicitly at the logical level and in exactly one way â€“ by values in tables.

Importance of Relational Databases:
Standardization of data model: Once your data is transformed into the rows and columns format, your data is standardized and you can query it with SQL
Flexibility in adding and altering tables: Relational databases gives you flexibility to add tables, alter tables, add and remove data.
Data Integrity: Data Integrity is the backbone of using a relational database.
Structured Query Language (SQL): A standard language can be used to access the data with a predefined language.
Simplicity : Data is systematically stored and modeled in tabular format.
Intuitive Organization: The spreadsheet format is intuitive but intuitive to data modeling in relational databases.
