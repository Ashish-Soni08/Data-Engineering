**Instructor:** _Amanda Moran_

In this course, you’ll learn to create relational and NoSQL data models to fit the diverse needs of data consumers. You’ll understand the differences between different data models, and how to choose the appropriate data model for a given situation. You’ll also build fluency in PostgreSQL and Apache Cassandra.

Learning Objective: Understand the strengths and weaknesses of different types of databases and data modeling techniques and how you can use them to organize your data that can be easily queried and utilized by your organization.

In this course you will learn:

What is a data model
Properties of relational and NoSQL databases
How to create relational data models
How to create NoSQL data models

Introduction to Databases and DBMS
Databases: A database is a structured repository or collection of data that is stored and retrieved electronically for use in applications. Data can be stored, updated, or deleted from a database.

Database Management System (DBMS): The software used to access the database by the user and application is the database management system.

In this course, we will focus on the physical data model to create DDLs in Relational and Non-Relational databases.

**Q. Why is Data Modeling Important?**

Ans: Data organization is critical. **The organization of your data for your applications is extremely important**

Key points about Data Modeling

- Data Organization: The organization of the data for your applications is extremely important and makes everyone's life easier.
- Use cases: Having a well thought out and organized data model is critical to how that data can later be used. Queries that could have been straightforward and simple might become complicated queries if data modeling isn't well thought out.
- Starting early: Thinking and planning ahead will help you be successful. Begin prior to building out application, business logic and analytical models. This is not something you want to leave until the last minute.
- Iterative Process: Data modeling is not a fixed process. It is iterative as new requirements and data are introduced. Having flexibility will help as new information becomes available.
